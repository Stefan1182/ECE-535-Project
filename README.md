# 2025 Spring ECE-535-Project
This project presents a hybrid autonomous navigation system tailored for resource-constrained embedded platforms. By integrating a local brightness-based heuristic model with cloud-based deep learning inference using YOLOv5 for object detection and Ultra-Fast-Lane-Detection (UFLD) for lane segmentation, the system balances real-time responsiveness with perception accuracy. A lightweight router determines offloading decisions based on proximity and frame brightness dynamics, while a model predictive control (MPC)-inspired controller maps discrete decisions to continuous motor commands. Deployed on a BeagleBone Black with a USB camera and ultrasonic sensor, the system demonstrates reliable obstacle avoidance and lane-aware navigation through modular design and efficient computation.
